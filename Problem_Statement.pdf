Problem Statement: Shopper Segmentation for Targeted Marketing

In the era of data-driven marketing, businesses strive to understand their customers better to deliver personalized experiences and targeted promotions. 
One critical aspect is shopper segmentation, where shoppers are grouped into distinct categories based on their behavior, preferences, and purchase patterns. 
This segmentation helps businesses optimize marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement.

Given a dataset containing information about shoppers, including their age, gender, and total spending in a category, 
the task is to build a predictive model that accurately segments shoppers into specific categories that represent their shopping preferences. 
These categories can include technology enthusiasts, food connoisseurs, fashion-conscious individuals, and beauty enthusiasts.

The dataset consists of the following features:

Age: The age of the shopper (numerical).
Gender: The gender of the shopper (categorical: male, female).
Total Spending: The total spending of the shopper in a particular category (numerical).
The target variable is the shopper segment, which can take one of the following labels:

Technology Enthusiast
Food Connoisseur
Fashion Conscious
Beauty Enthusiast
By accurately segmenting shoppers, businesses can achieve the following benefits:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Each shopper segment can be targeted with specific marketing campaigns tailored to their preferences. 
For example, technology enthusiasts may be interested in gadget launches and tech-related promotions, while fashion-conscious individuals 
may respond well to fashion shows or exclusive clothing discounts.

Personalized Recommendations: Understanding shopper segments enables businesses to provide personalized product recommendations, 
increasing the chances of conversion. By recommending relevant products or services based on a shopper's segment, businesses can enhance 
customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Inventory Management: Shopper segmentation helps businesses optimize inventory management. 
By identifying the preferences and buying patterns of different shopper segments, businesses can stock and promote products accordingly, 
reducing wastage and increasing profitability.

Customer Retention: Customized experiences based on shopper segments enhance customer satisfaction, leading to increased customer retention rates. 
By understanding the needs and preferences of different shopper segments, businesses can build long-term relationships and foster loyalty.

The developed predictive model will enable businesses to automatically segment shoppers based on their age, gender, and total spending in a category, 
facilitating data-driven decision-making and personalized marketing strategies.
